Function scope & context
object, assign objects as attributes
Functions, Arrays, Date are objects
the context of 'this'
stand alone or inner functions 'this' is a global object, in methods 'this' is the parent object
assigning objects functions to variables and running them will overwrite global variables***
demo 'new' by making function and assigning it's prototype to an object
show the danger of forgetting to write 'new' when instantiating objects, abstract instantiation to Object.prototype
revisit Functions, Arrays, Date as objects (prototypes of Function, Array, etc. constructor functions)
add prototype methods to objects used by constructors
storing/passing functions as arguments
.bind and .call
